    "summary":"In the pie chart, the financial figures are visually represented to illustrate their proportions. The total revenue of $191,388.84 is depicted as the entire pie, indicating the overall income generated. The expenses, totaling $139,493.05, are shown as a substantial slice of the pie, highlighting the significant portion of revenue allocated to costs. The remaining portion, which represents the net profit of $51,895.79, is displayed as a smaller slice, emphasizing the profit achieved after deducting expenses from revenue. This visual representation makes it easy to see that the expenses take up a large share, but the remaining slice illustrates a positive financial outcome. The net profit slice underscores the successful financial performance, demonstrating that despite significant expenses, the revenue sufficiently covered the costs and left a substantial profit."
